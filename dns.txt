SOA record stores:
- name of server that supplied data for the zone
- admin of the zone
- current version of the data file
- number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before checking for updates
- number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before retrying a failed zone transfer
- maximum number of seconds a secondary name server can use data before it must refresh or expire
- default number of seconds for the time-to-live (TTL) file on resource records

NS Records (Name Server Record)
- used by top level domain server to direct traffic to the Content DNS server which contains authoritative DNS records

A Records (Address Record)
- used to translate domain name to IP address

TTL Record (Time-To-Live Record)
- The Length that a record is cached on either the Resolving SErver or the users local PC

CName Record (Canonical Name Record)
- can be used to resolve one domain name to another (jordanviolet.com points to violetfamily.com)

Alias Record
- works like CName record in that you can map one DNS name to another
- CName can't be used for naked domain names, can't have CName for violetfamily.com, it must be either A Record or Alias

Exam Tips
- ELB do not have pre-defined IPv4 addresses, must resolve using DNS name
- Understand the difference between Alias Record and CName Record
- Given the choice, always choose an Alias Record over CName
