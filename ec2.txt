EC2 - web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud

On Demand
- for users that want low cost and flexibility
- applications with short term, spiky, unpredictable workloads
- initial testing on EC2

Reserved Instances
- apps with steady or predictable usage
- applications that require reserved capacity
- users can make up-front payments to reduce total cost
- Standard Reserved Instance
--- up to 75% off on-demand cost
- Convertible Reserved Instance
--- up to 54% off on-demand cost
--- capability to change attributes of Reserved Instance as long as exchange results in creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
- Scheduled Reserved Instance
--- available to launch within time window you reserved
--- allows you to match capacity reservation to a predictable, recurring schedule

Spot Instances
- flexible start and end times
- only feasible at very low compute prices
- users with urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity

Dedicated Hosts
- useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
- useful for licensing that doesn't support cloud deployments
- can be purchased on-demand
- can be purchased as reservation for up to 70% off on-demand price

Instance Types
F - FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)
I - IOPS
G - Graphics
H - High Disk Throughput
T - cheap general purpose (think T2 micro)
D - Density
R - RAM
M - Main choice for general purpose apps
C - Compute
P - Graphics (think Pics)
X - Extreme Memory

EBS - Elastic Block Storage
- Attach block storage to EC2 isntances
- placed in a specific AZ, automatically replicated to protect you from single-component failure
- if windows/linux installed on disk, it's called the "root device volume"

EBS Volume Types
- General Purpose SSD (GP2)
--- General purpose, price/performance balance
--- 3 IOPS/GB up to 10,000 IOPS and bursts up to 3,000 IOPS for extended periods for volumes 3334GB+
- Provisioned IOPS SDD (IO1)
--- Designed for IO intensive applications or NoSQL databases
--- Used when needing more than 10,000 IOPS
--- Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS/Volume
- Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
--- Big Data
--- Data warehouses
--- Log processing
--- Cannot be boot volume
- Cold HDD (SC1)
--- Lowest cost storage, infrequently accessed
--- Typically a file server
- Magnetic (Standard)
--- Lowest cost per gigabyte of all volume times that are bootable
--- start dev here and move up when you're ready

Exam Tips
Know EC2 Pricing Models
- On Demand
--- Pay by the second or hour
- Reserved
--- Reserve capacity, contracts are from 12-36 months
- Spot
--- Set a bid price and if spot price meets your bid it will be provisioned
--- Instances terminated when spot price goes out of range
--- won't be charged if AWS terminates instance, but you will be charged if you terminate it
- Dedicated Hosts
--- Used when licensing or multi-tenate is an issue

Know EC2 Instace Types
- (FIGHT DR MCPX)

Know EBS
- Storage Types
--- SSD, General Purpose GP2 (up to 10,000 IOPS)
--- SSD, Provisioned IOPS IO1 (MOre than 10,000 IOPS)
--- HDD, Throughput Optimized ST1 (frequently accessed workloads)
--- HDD, Magnetic Standard (cheap, infrequently accessed storage)
- Cannot mount EBS Volume to multiple EC2 instances; use EFS instead
- Termination Protection is turned off by default, you must turn it on
- On EBS-backed instance, default action is for the root EBS volume to be deleted when the instance is terminated
- EBS Root volumes of your DEFAULT AMI's cannot be encrypted (but third party tools can be used to encrypt)
- EBS Volumes can also be copied and then encrypted at that time
- Additional volumes can be encrypted

Know Volumes Vs Snapshots
- Volumes exist on EBS, virtual hard disk in the cloud
- Snapshots exist on S3
- You can take a snapshot of a volume, the snapshot will be stored on S3
- Snapshots are point-in-time copies of volumes
- Snapshots are incremental
- First snapshot takes a while
- Security
--- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
--- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
--- Snapshots can be shared, but only if they are not encrypted
- Snapshots of ROOT Device Volumes
--- Stop instances before taking snapshot of ROOT volume
- EBS Vs. Instance Store (Ephemeral Storage)
--- Instance Store volumes cannot be stopped
--- If underlying host in Instance Store fails, you lose your data
--- EBS can be stopped
--- Both can be rebooted, you won't lose your data
--- Both will be deleted on termination, but EBS offers option to keep
- Snapshotting RAID Array
--- Freeze the file system
--- Unmount RAID Array
--- Shutdown EC2 Instance

Know Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
- Regional, but can be copied to other regions

Know CloudWatch (monitoring)
- Standard (5minutes)
- Detailed (1minute)
- CloudWatch is for performance monitoring
- Unlike CloudTrail, which is for auditing AWS
- Dashboards
- Alarms
- Events
- Logs

Know Roles
- More secure than storing access key and secret access keys on instances
- Easier to Manage
- Can be assigned to EC2 instance AFTER provisioning
- Universal to region

Know Instance Meta-data
- Used to get information about an instance
- curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
- curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/

Know EFS Features
- Supports NFSv4 protocol
- Only pay for storage used
- Can scale to petabytes
- Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- Data stored across multiple AZ's
- Read After Write Consistency

Know Lambda
- Event-driven compute service
- Compute service, run code in response to requests

Know Placement Groups (assume clustered is implied, if not mentioned)
- Clustered Placement Groups
--- Always in one AZ, used for Big Data (low latency, high throughput)
- Spread Placement Groups
--- Important EC2 instance on separate hardware
